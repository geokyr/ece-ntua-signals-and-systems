Semester Project and Analytical Assignments for the [Signals and Systems](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3173) course, during the 3rd semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Project Description

The semester project required the use of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to solve a set of problems. The project included the following tasks.

- Designing Low-Pass Filters (Moving Average Filter)
- Designing Band-Pass Filters
- Analysis of Musical Signals
- Synthesis of Musical Signals as a Sum of Sinusoids

## Analytical Assignments

There were 2 analytical assignments in total. Each one had a set of problems to be solved. The assignments covered the following topics.

- Signal Symmetry, Shifts and Periodicity
- Signal Linearity, Time Invariance, Memory, Causality and BIBO Stability
- Signal Convolution and Correlation
- Fourier Series and Fourier Transform
- Sampling Theorem
- Time Response and Frequency Response of LTI Systems
- Transfer Function of LTI Systems
- LTI Systems and Linear Differential and Difference Equations
- Laplace Transform
- Z-Transform
- Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
